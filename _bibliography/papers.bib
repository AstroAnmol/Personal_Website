The Sanket mission is a technology demonstration designed to be flown on the Indian Space Research Organization’s {PSLV} Stage 4 Orbital Platform ({PS}4-{OP}) (Announcement of opportunity for orbital platform. Indian Space Research Organisation, Bangalore [1]) and aims to qualify the team’s Antenna Deployment System in Ultra High Frequency band to a {TRL}-7 (Technology Readiness Level) in Low Earth Orbit ({LEO}). Sanket, i.e. the complete system, comprises an {ADS} and an auxiliary system. The purpose of the auxiliary system is to test the {ADS} on {PS}4-{OP} simulating a 1U {CubeSat} mission life cycle and conditions. Sanket will be mounted on {PS}4-{OP} which remains in {LEO} for around 6 months. Our Antenna Deployment System is developed as an independent module that is compatible with standard {CubeSat} sizes 1U, 2U and 3U.},

	title = {{SIZLE}: Smallsat to Image Zodiacal Light Above Ecliptic},
  abstract = {This paper presents the mission design of SIZLE (SmallSat to Image Zodiacal Light Above the Ecliptic), a pioneering endeavor tailored for NASA's Astrophysics Pioneers Program. SIZLE's main science mission will aim to address fundamental questions outlined in the Decadal Strategy for Planetary Science and Astrobiology 2023-2032. The primary objective of this mission is to enhance our understanding of interplanetary dust grains by capturing imagery of the zodiacal light. Furthermore, SIZLE aims to demonstrate the viability of solar sails as a propulsion system for reaching remote observation points above the ecliptic. The continuous thrust generated by solar winds equips spacecraft with the capability for extended missions requiring substantial changes in velocity. While practical realization of SIZLE's trajectory demands advancements in solar sail materials and technology, solar sails offer an enticing avenue for achieving SIZLE's mission objectives. This paper documents the mission and spacecraft design. The designed trajectory will put the spacecraft in a 30 degree inclined heliocentric orbit with a 1 AU semi-major axis. This final orbit maximises the science imaging capabilities of the mission. All scientific instruments and components on the spacecraft have been chosen as commercial off the shelf (COTS) components. This choice minimizes the time needed to manufacture the spacecraft since minimal integration and testing would be needed. The greatest technological development required for SIZLE would be advancements in solar sail technology.},

	title = {Development of an Empirical Model of the Force between Paramagnetic Particles in Uniform Magnetic Field on M-type Asteroids},
  abstract = {M-type asteroids may have remanent magnetic fields. Regolith particles on M-type asteroids are likely to have metallic components, causing them to be paramagnetic and respond to an external magnetic field. Paramagnetic particles placed in an external magnetic field are influenced by induced magnetic moments of neighboring particles. Therefore, the magnetic force between regolith particles on an M-type asteroid can change the net cohesion of the regolith. Previous works have shown the influence of cohesive forces in the evolution of rubble-pile asteroids. This work characterizes the magnetic force between regolith particles on M-type asteroids. We implement existing models of the magnetic force between paramagnetic particles placed in an external magnetic field and then present an empirical model of this force for two magnetic field orientations as an essential step toward a general semiempirical model that the wider planetary science community can more easily use to investigate the significance of this force.},

The satellite was operational, but the mission was only 90\% successful as only the beacon signal was received and not the downlink signal.

This paper gives some generic suggestions and tips which can be incorporated throughout different phases of the project to avoid similar mistakes in future missions.},

During the post-launch analysis, the team realized the importance of maintaining the quality. The {IIT} Bombay Student Satellite Team then started working on instituting quality assurance and management practices within the team. In the process, we listed and made few guidelines that can be useful for initiating and managing quality assurance in Student Satellite Projects across the world.
